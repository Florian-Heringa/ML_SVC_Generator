# ML_SVC_Model_Generator
 A simple complete system for generating random dataclouds to be used with a SCV classifier from sklearn. Running all cells will generate data, create and SVC and train the model. Finally all parameters will be stored and the model will be saved as an .onnx file.

 First multiple dataclouds can be generated

Then an SVC model is trained that separated the classes

It is also possible to choose a different SVC kernel
